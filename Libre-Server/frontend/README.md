## Libre Frontend

The Libre frontend is built completely in [React](https://react.dev/), using SCSS to style the pages along with component libraries and frameworks like:
- [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [React With TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

Our file directory is made up of two main files, with `src` containing the main data and `public` containing metadata. `src/components` contains the reusable react components we use to streamline development. `src/floors` contains the images that we use to display the individual rooms in each library floor. `src/img` contains all images used. `src/routes` contains the webpages used for Libre and their respective `.scss` and `.tsx` files.
