# Libre
Libre is a platform allowing students to reserve individual study rooms in university libraries.

This project was thought of as a solution to combat the hassle students face when trying to find an open study room at RPI. Students have the ability to view which rooms are empty via a map, coloring in the occupied rooms while lighting up the empty rooms.
