# Libre
A platform allowing students to reserve individual study rooms in Folsom Library and see which rooms are currently available. This project was thought of as a solution to combat the hassle students face when trying to find an open study room. Students have the ability to view which rooms are empty via a map, coloring in the occupied rooms while lighting up the empty rooms. Once the foundation has been built up, together with the library staff, we hope to put qr codes to allow for easy crowdsourcing of occupancy data. We understand that there is a significant issue with crowdsourcing data (Shuttle Tracker) however, this concept has been proved to work before in other universities2 which makes us confident that there is a way to make this work at RPI.
